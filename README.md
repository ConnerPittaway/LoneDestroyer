# LoneDestroyer
I created a solar system within OpenGL which can be traversed by using a Star Destroyer. The framework created is able to handle
many entities on screen as well as allowing for accurate movement for the Star Destroyer with acceleration for turning and movement.
I learned a lot about shaders, model loading and how to use OpenGL to create scenes. A video of the project can be found at https://youtu.be/XnaRmuEqx5I
